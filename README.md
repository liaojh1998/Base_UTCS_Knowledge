# Base UTCS Knowledge

This repo contains a lot of information that CS majors are expected to just accumulate along the way. It also has some stuff that is purely extra and ultra nerdy. 

Hopefully some of it will keep you from feeling overwhelmed or stupid as you continue on your CS journey.

## Enjoy! :)

PS: All the pdfs have a red "SUGGEST AN EDIT" link at the bottom that will send you to the google doc that the pdfs were generated from with comment permissions. (Note: you will have to download the pdf for the link to work)
