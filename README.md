# Base UTCS Knowledge

This repo contains a lot of information that CS majors are expected to just accumulate along the way. It also has some stuff that is purely extra and ultra nerdy. 

Hopefully some of it will keep you from feeling overwhelmed or stupid as you continue on your CS journey.

## Enjoy! :)
